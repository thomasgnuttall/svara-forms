## Svara-Form Clusters for Ri

The descriptions below describe the melodic movement of the svara-form in terms of the svara positions traversed by the melody. In performance, these are usually joined by a sliding motion. To make these descriptions comprehensible for a wide audience, simple language rather than gamaka terms are used to describe the melodic movement. Underscore (_) is used to represent a held pitch position. Parentheses around a svara indicate that it is barely touched and may sometimes be hard to hear. The svara positions are represented by the first letter of the syllable (p = pa). Both d1 and d2 exist in this raga, and so are differentiated here.

| cluster_5   | r_(s)                                  | the drop down to sa at the end is seen in the pitch curve to variable degrees but they all sound similar                                                                                                                                |
| cluster_6   | r                                      | some of the examples with longer duration have quite a bit of vibrato and could potentially be categorized as a different svara-form; they are not separated here because they exist more on a continuum than as separable categories.  |
