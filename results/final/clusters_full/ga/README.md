## Svara-Form Clusters for Ga

The descriptions below describe the melodic movement of the svara-form in terms of the svara positions traversed by the melody. In performance, these are usually joined by a sliding motion. To make these descriptions comprehensible for a wide audience, simple language rather than gamaka terms are used to describe the melodic movement. Underscore (_) is used to represent a held pitch position. Parentheses around a svara indicate that it is barely touched and may sometimes be hard to hear. The svara positions are represented by the first letter of the syllable (p = pa). Both d1 and d2 exist in this raga, and so are differentiated here.
